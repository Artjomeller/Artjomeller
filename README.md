👋 Hi, I’m @Artjomeller
👀 Most of time I deal with web developing (Javascript, React). I am also very interested in UI/UX development.
🌱 I am a career changer: from chef to IT.
🌱 I have been learning software development since August 2023.
🌱 I’m currently learning software development in Kehtna Kutsehariduskeskus (vocational school in Estonia).
✨  Did my first internship.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mostly on web development.
📫 Contact me through my Github profile or find me somewhere:).
